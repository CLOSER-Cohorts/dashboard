These are helping researchers to understand the spread of the virus, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of Next Steps you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by Next Steps. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. If you are completing the survey on a mobile device please click HERE to download the app. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study WEBSITE. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. If you DO NOT wish your information held by Next Steps to b/e linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app [please tick the first box below/. Otherwise, select 'Continue' to receive your voucher for taking part. For further information about how your symptoms tracker data will be securely linked, and how it will be used for research, please see our FAQs, here. You can also opt out of linking your Next Steps information to the symptoms tracker at any time by calling us for free on 0800 977 4566 or email us at nextsteps@ucl.ac.uk."},

These are helping to slow the outbreak, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of Next Steps you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by Next Steps. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. Please click HERE (https://covid.joinzoe.com/) to download the app. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study website (https://nextstepsstudy.org.uk/faqs/#covid19tracker). If you DO NOT wish your information held by Next Steps to be linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app please tick the box below."},

These are helping researchers to understand the spread of the virus, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of NCDS you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by NCDS. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. If you are completing the survey on a mobile device please click HERE to download the app. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study WEBSITE. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. If you DO NOT wish your information held by NCDS to be linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app please tick the first box below For further information about how your symptoms tracker data will be securely linked, and how it will be used for research, please see our FAQs, here. You can also opt out of linking your NCDS information to the symptoms tracker at any time by calling us for free on 0800 0355761 or email us at ncds@ucl.ac.uk."},

These are helping researchers to understand the spread of the virus, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of Child of the New Century you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by Child of the New Century. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. If you are completing the survey on a mobile device please click HERE to download the app. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study WEBSITE. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. If you DO NOT wish your information held by Child of the New Century to be linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app please tick the first box below. Otherwise, select ‘Continue’. For further information about how your symptoms tracker data will be securely linked, and how it will be used for research, please see our FAQs, here. You can also opt out of linking your Child of the New Century information to the symptoms tracker at any time by calling us for free on 0800 0921250 or email us at childnc@ucl.ac.uk."},

These are helping researchers to understand the spread of the virus, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of Child of the New Century you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by Child of the New Century. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. If you are completing the survey on a mobile device please click HERE to download the app. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study WEBSITE. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. If you DO NOT wish your information held by Child of the New Century to be linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app please tick the first box below. Otherwise, select ‘Continue’. For further information about how your symptoms tracker data will be securely linked, and how it will be used for research, please see our FAQs, here. You can also opt out of linking your Child of the New Century information to the symptoms tracker at any time by calling us for free on 0800 0921250 or email us at childnc@ucl.ac.uk."},

These are helping researchers to understand the spread of the virus, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of BCS70 you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by BCS70. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. If you are completing the survey on a mobile device please click HERE to download the app. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study WEBSITE. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. If you DO NOT wish your information held by BCS70 to be linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app please tick the first box below/ Otherwise, select ‘Continue’. For further information about how your symptoms tracker data will be securely linked, and how it will be used for research, please see our FAQs, here. You can also opt out of linking your BCS70 information to the symptoms tracker at any time by calling us for free on 0800 0355761 or email us at bcs70@ucl.ac.uk."},

These are helping researchers to understand the spread of the virus, by recording which symptoms are most common, and identifying high risk areas in the UK. As a member of BCS70 you can play a special role. We have teamed up with the organisations running the COVID-19 symptom tracker, designed by Kings College London, to allow the results from the symptoms tracker app to be combined with the information held by BCS70. All you need to do is to download the app on your mobile device, and record your symptoms every day. If you have already been recording your symptoms using this app, the symptoms you have already recorded can also be linked. If you are completing the survey on a mobile device please click HERE to download the app. You can also find the link to download the symptoms tracker app on our study WEBSITE. You can download the symptoms tracker and start recording your symptoms at any time. If you DO NOT wish your information held by BCS70 to be linked to information collected by the COVID-19 symptom tracker app please tick the first box below. Otherwise, select ‘Continue’. For further information about how your symptoms tracker data will be securely linked, and how it will be used for research, please see our FAQs, here. You can also opt out of linking your BCS70 information to the symptoms tracker at any time by calling us for free on 0800 0355761 or email us at bcs70@ucl.ac.uk."},
